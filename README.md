#Rscripts and markdown files on scRNA-seq data from mouse cortex at E14.5

This repository contains R scripts and Rmarkdown documentation of my analysis on scRNA-seq data generated from the murine neocortex at embryonic stage E14.5. Once published, the data would be retrievable via the GEO accession number: GSE176323.
